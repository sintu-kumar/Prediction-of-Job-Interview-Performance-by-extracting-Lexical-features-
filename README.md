# Prediction-of-Job-Interview-Performance-by-extracting-Lexical-features-
Our framework (1) quantify the relative inﬂuences of diﬀerent low level features on the interview outcome, (2) learns regression models to predict interview ratings and the likelihood of hiring using automatically extracted features, and (3) predicts several other high-level personality traits such as engagement, friendliness, and excitement. One of our objectives is to extend the existing automated conversation systems by providing feedback on the overall interview performance and additional high-level personality traits.
